## List technologies used: ##
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Heroku

## Unsolved problems to be fixed in future iterations: ##
I would like to rename my 'Day' resource 'Entry'. An 'entry' is a more accurate description of the resource, as a User could have more than one entry per day.

## Planning, development process, and problem-solving strategy: ##
I referenced my examples and built a lot of the structure from the Rails scaffold. I leaned on my classmates for help and was able to keep my back-end lean and mean without too many issues. As I build out the front-end with more features, I will certainly run into more limitations and problems to solve.
